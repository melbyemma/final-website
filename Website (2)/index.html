<p> Over the semester of this class, I have experienced many personal challenges but also have grown in my skills as a digital communicator. I have gone from someone who had never written code before, to someone who understands how a webpage is built and functions, and can do that work myself. This semester has been a struggle for me, but I have learned a lot and changed my digital literacy drastically. When I visit a webpage, I now look at how difficult it is to craft something of that scope and have a new appreciation for the huge diversity of webpages out there.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the skills I have gained, I have linked to my Solar Panel DITA generated PDF, which includes information and resources on calculating energy savings from various types of solar panels. </p>

    <p>This class has been challenging, but I am happy looking back on how I was only able to use mass market web builders, such as wix and google sites, and can now write my own site in HTML or with DITA. I also created this webpage in conjunction with this course for another class. I utilized google sites, but used HTML to edit certain functions and used what I learned about accesibility to improve the quality of the site. The link to this site (Unmasking Polymet) is <a

        <p>Thank you for a great semester and all your help!</p>
